# Web Scraping for Industry Analysis - Canoo

## Overview

This Python script is designed for web scraping to gather information about Canoo, an electric vehicle manufacturer, from a specified URL. The script utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract data from the HTML structure of the target webpage. The extracted information includes details about Canoo's industry, main competitors, market trends, and financial performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, csv

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Update the `canoo_url` variable in the script with the URL of the webpage containing relevant information about Canoo.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python web_scraping_canoo.py
```

3. The script will print the scraped data to the console and save it to a CSV file named `canoo_data.csv`.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script according to your specific requirements:

- Adjust the HTML elements and classes used for data extraction based on the structure of the target webpage.
- Modify the CSV file handling, data storage, and printing as needed.

## Recommendations

- Regularly update the script to accommodate changes in the HTML structure of the target webpage.
- Verify the legality and adherence to terms of service for web scraping on the specified webpage.
- Consider implementing additional error handling and logging for improved script robustness.
